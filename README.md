This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing hospital visitor and patient data to uncover insights into healthcare service usage, patient demographics, and operational efficiency.

---

##  Features & Scope
- **Data Modeling & ETL**: Cleaned, transformed, and organized data using Power Query Editor.
- **Metrics & DAX**: Created KPIs using DAX to measure average wait times, patient satisfaction scores, visit patterns (AM/PM), and department referrals.
- **Visual Insights**: Interactive visuals showing demographic breakdowns (age/gender), visit time trends, satisfaction distribution, and referral flows.
